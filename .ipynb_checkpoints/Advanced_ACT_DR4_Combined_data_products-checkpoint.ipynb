This is distinct from the HealPix format commonly used in cosmology.  Therfore we provide an introduction to the tools needed for manipulating these maps and for converting between HealPix and CAR format.   The library that accomplishes this is called [PIXELL](https://github.com/simonsobs/pixell).  \n",

The properties of these maps (resolution, effective white noise level, area etc) are provided in table XXX.  <font color=red>(make this table)</font>  For more details on the coadded data products and to understand the methods used to produce the maps please reference Naess et al.

These maps include CMB+kSZ maps and Compton-$y$ maps along with versions of these maps the specifically deproject indvidual components.  These maps can be used to study the pressure profiles of galxies, groupd and clusters as well as for lensing reconstruction and kinematic SZ cross-correlations Madhavacheril et al. (2020)."

The polarization angle has been calibrated, but the polarization leakage of the beam has not been corrected and we do not provide a complete noise model.  We will release fully vetted polarization maps including splits with which the noise can be evaluated in a future release.  In the present form cosmological analysis of these spectra is not possible though one can use these coadded maps for studies of foregrounds, the galaxy, and (with proper care) point source properties.\n",

    "The ILC approach uses a linear co-addition of input maps in multiple frequences to minimize variance of the final map while preserving the signal of interest.  It does so solely by relying on information about the frequency dependence of the various components.  Traditionally the ILC method doesn't explicitly remove any foregrounds, however, our approach works to explicitly null some of the foreground contamination.  However, it is important to note that since it is not possible to fully remove foreground contamination the auto-power spectrums of the resulting maps should be interpreted with significant caution.\n",
