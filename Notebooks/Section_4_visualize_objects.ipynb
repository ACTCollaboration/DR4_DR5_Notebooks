    "If we want to stack objects in the map it's relatively easy to do so, but we need to use a slightly different approach.  Instead of using a bounding box and cutting a submap from the map we can use pixell's reproject.postage_stamp function to cut out \"stamps\" that are reprojected at the center of each object. \n",

Users can specify the type of projection using the \"proj\" keyword. The default is a \"gnomonic\" projection, but since our stamp size is small, we can keep everything as \"car\" and continue to use our handy eshow function to build plots."
