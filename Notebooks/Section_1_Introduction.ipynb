    "This notebook provides an overview of the ACT data release 4 (DR4) data products and an introduction to accessing and manipulating these products.  The data products (summarized in Table 1)  include temperature and polarization maps, a lensing map, and component seperated maps. The full DR4 data release on LAMBDA also includes derived products including angular power spectra, masks and beams, and likelihoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "DR4 contains raw maps at 98 and 150 GHz covering nearly half the sky as well as co-adds of the 98, 150 and 220 GHz channels.  Previous analyses used only ~650 sq deg of sky; this data release provides maps that cover ~18,000 sq degrees.  We provide these maps both independently and combined with data from the Planck satellite.  For more details on the raw and coadded data products and to understand the methods used to produce the maps please reference [Naess et al. (2020)](https://www.overleaf.com/5395816498bsknshgxbmyr) for the coadded maps and [Aiola et al. (2020)](https://phy-wiki.princeton.edu/polwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Papers.Papers?action=download&upname=ACT_DR4_A20_v20200420.pdf) for the raw maps. \n",

    "We include raw maps that include night time data from Season 13 through 16 at 98 and 150 GHz.  The maps cover more than 17,000 sq degrees, with the deepest 600 sq degrees having noise levels below 10µK–arcmin.  These maps are discussed in more depth in [Aiola et al. (2020)](https://phy-wiki.princeton.edu/polwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Papers.Papers?action=download&upname=ACT_DR4_A20_v20200420.pdf). As mentioned, we also include coadded maps, combining data from Season 08 through 16 across patches, and at higher frequencies (including 220 GHz) than the raw maps. In particular, the coadd maps include data from the MBAC instrument, ACTPol receiver, and AdvancedACT receiver, along with Planck data [Naess et al. (2020)](https://www.overleaf.com/5395816498bsknshgxbmyr). Together, these data comprise the primary DR4 map products, from which the following products are derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "DR4 includes the lensing maps discussed in [Darwish et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01139.pdf/).  The maps are constructed using two frequency bands, 98 GHz and 150 GHz, and data from seasons 2014 - 2015 in two regions of the sky, BOSS-North (\\~1633 sq. degrees of sky) and D56 (\\~456 sq. degrees). \n",
    "\n",
    "We also include component separated maps in the D56 and BOSS-North regions.  These maps include CMB+kSZ maps and Compton-$y$ maps along with versions of these maps that specifically deproject individual components.  These maps can be used to study the pressure profiles of galaxies, groups, and clusters, as well as for lensing reconstruction and kinematic SZ cross-correlations [Madhavacheril et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05717.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "These data are stored in the CAR (or Plate Carée) format as ndmap objects, which are based off of the numpy array framework.   This is distinct from the [HEALPix](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/) format commonly used in cosmology.  Therefore we provide an introduction to the tools needed for manipulating these maps and for converting between HEALPix and CAR format.   The library that accomplishes this is called [Pixell](https://github.com/simonsobs/pixell).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously ACT maps were made with the cylindrical equal-area (CEA) projection.  This worked well for smaller areas but due to the new larger area of the ACT survey we have adopted the Plate Carée pixelization.  The CAR projection, as described above, is a rectangular projection, however, it is not a flat sky projection.  Instead, in each latitude ring, pixels are spaced such that there are equal number of pixels in each latitude ring.  This means that the physical space between pixels depends on the ring and pixels near the equator have a larger physical space difference between them than pixels near the poles.  [Pixell's](https://github.com/simonsobs/pixell) functionality handles this complexity, allowing us to run spherical harmonic, and thus curved-sky, analyses on the maps despite presenting them as 2D Numpy objects [Choi et al. (2020)](https://phy-wiki.princeton.edu/polwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Papers.Papers?action=download&upname=choi_etal_2020.pdf).\n",

    "The data themselves can be found on the [NASA Legacy Archive Microwave\n",
    "Background Data Analysis website](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/).  Users are welcome to use those data products and the examples shared in these notebooks in order to learn more about the new data set. In order to facilitate better understanding, we also provide auxilliary data (hosted on [here, on NERSC](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/act/zatkins/DR4_Notebooks_supplementary_data/)) which is used periodically in the notebooks. This data is for demonstrations purposes only.\n",

    "DR4 includes a multitude of data products as discussed above.  These notebooks will focus on introducing the range of products and demonstrating how to access and examine the various maps. In particular, the first few notebooks will introduce users to the Pixell framework: demonstrating how to read in CAR maps and view objects in the maps.
