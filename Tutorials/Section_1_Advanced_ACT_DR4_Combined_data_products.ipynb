    "This notebook provides an overview of the Advanced ACTPol (AdvACT) data release 4 (DR4) data products and an introduction to accessing and manipulating these products.  The data products (summarized in Table 1)  include temperature and polarization maps, a lensing map, and component seperated maps. \n",

    "DR4 contains raw maps at 90, and 150 GHz covering nearly half the sky as well as co-adds of the 90, 150 and 220 GHz channels.  Previous analyses used only ~650 sq deg of sky; this data release provides maps that cover ~ 18,000 sq degrees.  We provide these maps both independently and combined with data from the Planck satellite.  For more details on the coadded data products and to understand the methods used to produce the maps please reference [Naess et al. (2020)](https://www.overleaf.com/5395816498bsknshgxbmyr). \n",

    "DR4 includes the lensing maps discussed in [Darwish et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01139.pdf/).  The maps are constructed using two frequency bands, 98 GHz and 150 GHz and data from seasons 2014 - 2015 in two regions of the sky, BOSS-North ( \\~1633 sq. degrees of sky) and D56 (\\~ 456 sq. degrees). \n",

    "We also include component separated maps in the D56 and BOSS-North regions.  These maps include CMB+kSZ maps and Compton-$y$ maps along with versions of these maps the specifically deproject individual components.  These maps can be used to study the pressure profiles of galaxies, groups and clusters as well as for lensing reconstruction and kinematic SZ cross-correlations [Madhavacheril et al. (2020)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hnjnxpzgrrtp).\n",

    "Finally we include raw maps that include night time data from Season 13 through 16 at 98 and 150 GHz.  The maps cover more than 17,000 sq degrees, with the deepest 600 sq degrees having noise levels below 10µK–arcmin.  These maps won't be used in this notebook but are discussed in more depth in [Aiola et al. (2020)](https://phy-wiki.princeton.edu/polwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Papers.Papers?action=download&upname=ACT_DR4_A20_v20200420.pdf)and are used in the companion notebook.  \n",

    "These data are stored in the CAR (or Plate Carée) format as ndmap objects.  These are based off of numpy arrays and include a 2D array and a WCS object that includes information needed to relate the 2D array to the celestial sphere.  This is distinct from the [HEALPix](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/) format commonly used in cosmology.  Therefore we provide an introduction to the tools needed for manipulating these maps and for converting between HEALPix and CAR format.   The library that accomplishes this is called [PIXELL](https://github.com/simonsobs/pixell).  \n",
