    "This section will walk users through how to use Pixell and access maps.  The demonstration is done using the 150 GHz ACT + Planck S08-18 coadded maps discussed in [Naess et al. (2020)](https://www.overleaf.com/5395816498bsknshgxbmyr).  The other coadded maps provided are listed in Table 2.  Substituting these file names allows you to switch between frequencies, maps built with and without Planck, and the coadded map used in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "These coadded maps which cover an area of $0^o < RA < 360^o$, $-62^o < dec < 22^o$ and include variations with and without Planck data.  The maps correspond to an area of 26.4 thousand square degrees, of which about 70% is exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each frequency, we provide both temperature and polarization data.  The polarization angle has been calibrated, but the polarization leakage of the beam has not been corrected and we do not provide a complete noise model.  We will release fully vetted polarization maps including splits with which the noise can be evaluated in a future release.  In the present form cosmological analysis of these spectra is not possible though one can use these coadded maps for studies of foregrounds, the galaxy, and (with proper care) point source properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "These maps are produced by combining observations from multiple seasons and arrays as well as from both ACT and Planck. The results are combined multi season maps that are easier to use and understand than the individual season or array maps used to create them.   \n",
    "\n",
    "These maps include data from a range of seasons including preliminary data from season 17 and 18.  Although the S17-18 data has been characterized the data has not been subjected to all of the tests of a proper data release meaning that gain/beam errors of several precent should be expected.  These maps are explained in much greater detail in [Naess et al. (2020)](https://www.overleaf.com/5395816498bsknshgxbmyr)\n",

    "One of the advantages of using the CAR and Pixell framework is that you can easily select a small region of the map to examine in more detail.  Users can select a submap at a specific location by creating a bounding box around a central location in RA and DEC.  For example if we wanted to visualize an object at RA = 0 and dec = 0  we can create a box, with a width of 5 degrees, around this location.  Note that Pixell takes in bounding boxes in radians so here we convert the dec, ra and width to radians using numpy before forming the box.\n",
